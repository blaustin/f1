This is a CS32 Final Project by Brice Austin and John Deneen

The basis of this project is to build a script that inputs data about F1 drivers on a lap by lap basis and uses a predictive algorithm to determine the odds of a certain driver winning. This script will utilize variables such as track, weather conditions, driver positions, driver lap times, tire wear, DRS, and number of pit stops to determine the likelyhood of one driver overtaking another on a given lap. This information will then be used to predict the probability that a given driver will win the race.
